    <p>You know HTML, CSS and <a href="">Javascript</a>. You have built a few projects yourself. 
        You understand how to work with Github, and perhaps you also know how to create a simple Node.js server 
        (if not you should check out this). But you still feel like you know a tiny bit in a giant universe of skills. 
        Where should you get started? What happens if your boss asks you to be in charge of a project? How will you know 
        how to make good architectural decisions?</p>

    "In order to keep up with the industry, your best bet is to be efficient and be wise about 
    what you spend time on because it is impossible to learn and know everything."

<p>As with most of my articles, we want to focus on efficiency. We all have the same hours in a day, 
    but some people are able to learn and do more than others. Why is that? Well, some people are more 
    efficient than others at learning and doing. I hope this guide will give you at least a roadmap so 
    you donâ€™t have to figure out what you need to learn (I already did that for you) and you can get 
    started right away in an efficient way.
